    Hand Tracking & Image Capture using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to perform real-time hand tracking through a webcam and automatically save captured frames as images with detected hand landmarks.

Each frame is processed in real time, hand landmarks are drawn on the image, and the result is saved as a `.jpg` file using a unique UUID filename.
